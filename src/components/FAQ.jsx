                  a="The Sauder application had 2 more questions than the
                  regular UBC personal profile (e.g. science, arts,
                  engineering, etc.)
                  
                  These were my written questions (concise)â€”I believe they changed one of the questions to address your experiences in COVID:
                  
                  - How did you respond to a problem? (200 words)
                  - What social issue is important to you? Why? How have
                  you addressed it? (200 words)
                  - How would your community/friends/fan describe you?
                  (250 words)
                  - What is important to you and why? (250 words)
                  - Describe 5 activities you do (50 words each)
                  - Elaborate on 1-2 activities (350 words)
                  - Additional info (100 words)
                  - Clarification (2000 chars)
                  
                  Answer 2 questions in an online interview for ~1 min each.
                  They record you but there's no actual person there while
                  you record. My questions were **describe a time when you encountered conflict in a team** and **do you like working in a group or independently**? I heard they usually throw one practical question and one random question (my friend was asked what superhero he would be and why), but I was asked two practicals.
                  
                  Send your transcript-your school will hopefully walk you
                  through that."
